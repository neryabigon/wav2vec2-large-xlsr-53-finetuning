ASR Improvement Using Data Augmentation for Under-Represented Languages
-----  
In this [paper](https://github.com/neryabigon/wav2vec2-large-xlsr-53-finetuning/blob/main/ASR%20Augmented%20Wav2Vec2.0.pdf), we propose a novel approach to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance for under-represented languages using data augmentation.

Our approach augments the training data by synthesizing new speech data using a combination of noise injection, speed changes, and frequency masking. We show that our technique significantly improves the ASR performance for under-represented languages.
